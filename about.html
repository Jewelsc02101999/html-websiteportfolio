<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I started my writing journey by writing poetry, performing and creating original content around London.
    I then went on to organise workshops in Derbyshire to encourage young people to express themselves and build their confidence. <br>My studies at The University of Derby, where I studied Global Development, ignited my interest in long-form writing and research skills and gave me the opportunity to write my own think pieces on global matters.
    I worked with the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, where Iâ€™d write articles and managed social media posts, which helped me expand my writing skills and develop a deep interest in copywriting, I then went on to write and improve website copy for multiple businesses.<br>
    My ability to understand the tone of voice for different businesses and engage with diverse audiences made me the writer I am today. I can get into the minds of my clients to articulate exactly what they want to say and deliver it appropriately.</p>
