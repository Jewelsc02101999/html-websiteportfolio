<h1>Copywriting</h1>
<hr>
<p>My writing has led me to work with different businesses, writing copy for their web pages, creating email chains to engage their audience, newsletters and more. I know that having a business is a lot to handle so that’s where I come in, you need words to talk to your customers and I have the right ones for you.</p><hr>

<p>At Tecric I wrote 4 blogs to help increase there engagement and website visibility. <br>How did I do it? Compiled a list of 10 topics related to web-design, business, and tech space. Out of those, I selected 4 topics which cover CMS softwares, growing your business, and branding. I divided these into 3 tasks: 
<br>
    1. Collect as much research material as possible on each topic through articles, blogs and research papers.<br>
    2. Write as much as I can on each topic (Forget about corrections at this stage).<br>
    3. Proofread and edit the content to ensure its accuracy and readability.</p>

<p>At the charity MTV Staying Alive Foundation I curated a video article celebrating pride month.<br>How did I do it? I delved into some research on the topic of pride. I went through various resources such as history books, articles, and videos. <br>Then, I wrote out an article using the brand’s tone of voice. To enhance the article, I sourced video assets that demonstrated the image of the text created.<br> Finally, I used the software DaVinci Resolve to edit and render out the video. For publishing the content, I utilised the CMS platform Wix to create the website.  </p>
